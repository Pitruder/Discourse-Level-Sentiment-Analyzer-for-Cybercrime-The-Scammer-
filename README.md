This project presents a comprehensive study on developing a Discourse Level Sentiment Analyzer (DLSA) specifically designed for detecting cyber scams that utilize pressure and coercive language. By extending the research conducted by Mathias and Kraus (2019), this project aims to apply and evaluate their discourse-aware sentiment analysis solution within the context of scams. The DLSA will focus on identifying and analyzing the sentiment at the discourse level, capturing the nuances and subtleties of pressure tactics and coercive language often employed in cyber scams.

In addition to its core objective, this project also explores the feasibility of DLSA as a practical tool for detecting and preventing cyber scams.
